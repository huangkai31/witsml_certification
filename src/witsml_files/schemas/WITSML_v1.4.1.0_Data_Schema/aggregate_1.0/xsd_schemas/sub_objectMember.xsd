		<xsd:documentation>WITSML Substitution Group Members.
		This file can be edited to import object schemas for use in the aggregate object.
		The default is that there are no data object members. This is so that the aggregate object can be used
		with any version in any namespace.
		The schemas for each Energistics domain (e.g., WITSML, PRODML, RESQML) will contain
		a file named something like sub_objectMemberXxxxxxx.xsd where Xxxxxxx indicates the domain.
		The contents of that member file will list the includes all of the objects which can be expected to be added to this list.
		If the aggregate may contain anything in that domain then the domain's member fle can be imported as-is.
		If a subset of that list is expected in the aggregate, a copy of the member file may be added (e.g., to this folder)
		and edited to remove undesired objects.
